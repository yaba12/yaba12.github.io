		<div>
			<p>Hello, my name is Bryan Cheng and I currently attend University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>I was raised in Southern California so the weather right now is taking a huge toll on me. Please help I've never experienced weather like this for an extended period of time. I do not know how people are surviving in this weather. /s I heard it goes below 0 degrees Fahrenheit here and I am not ready.</p>

			<p>In my free time I enjoy talking to my friends over Discord, playing games, mainly League of Legends, with some other games such as CSGO or Overwatch. I love reddit. When reddit goes down, I attempt to check reddit to see what happened on reddit only to find out that I am not that smart.</p>
